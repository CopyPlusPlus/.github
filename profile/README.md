**Copy++** is a tool software that aims to make copying easier by processing texts automatically, like removing the redundant whitespaces when you copy a PDF file.

What you need to do is just **copy and paste**. No more formatting texts by yourself after copying.

**Free yourself!**

----

There are two versions of Copy++.

One is based on [WPF/C#](https://github.com/CopyPlusPlus/CopyPlusPlus) and it's the initial and current version.

Another one is based on [Qt/C++](https://github.com/CopyPlusPlus/CopyPlusPlus-Qt). Its biggest advantage is cross-platform. It's still under development and will be released soon.
